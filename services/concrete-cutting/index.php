						 <h2>Concrete Saw Cutting and Wire Saw Cutting</h2>
                   <p>We employ modern technologies in Concrete Cutting to cut through reinforced concrete. Our personalized solutions combined with over a decade of expertise in the field guarantee peace of mind at economical time-saving plan. We apply a non-vibration system to minimize vibrations to undetectable extremes.</p>

                   <p>Concrete cutting works has been so popular nowadays and almost everyone is familiar with the blade that can cut the reinforced concrete or the wire that can go through almost any concrete structure. If you want to know more about these services and how the process goes, please read below.</p>

                   <p>With cutting-edge machinery and a team of highly skilled operations managers, we at WEM are able to perform cost-effective concrete cutting work in Dubai. We can cut various shapes including a simple 90-degree shaped slab, as well as angled slabs or circular sections.
</p>
                         <!-- <p>Concrete coring utilizes a diamond cutting drill to cut a perfect round hole in any concrete structure. The process is low-noise, dust free and non-percussive. It is by far the most popular choice when it comes to cutting concrete. The process can be carried out on a variety of surfaces, including concrete and asphalt, masonry and wood. Most concrete cutting services are available throughout the UAE but they may vary depending on the place where you live</p>
                         <p>WEM as  a concrete coring and cutting service providers in Dubai with the biggest fleet of machines is  too experienced in the field of concrete coring, we have executed different coring jobs with a huge depth of more than 10M with special core bits. WEM specialty is to ensure that any job to be completed within stipulated time period as per specified budget.</p>
						 <p>We break out our wire saw equipment for those really big pieces of concrete or concrete structures that simply cannot be cut with anything else.</p>
						 
						 <p>The wire saw is one of the most unique pieces of equipment in the <a href="https://www.wemts.com/services/concrete-cutting/">concrete cutting</a> industry, with literally no limit to how big a piece of concrete it can cut.</p>

						<p>Able to cut from a variety of angles, wire saws are incredibly versatile tools.</p>

						<p>Though the wire saw is actually one of the more complicated tools we use, it essentially involves wrapping a special type of wire around the object being cut, then uses pulleys to guide the wire through the object to make the cut.</p>

						<p>To operate, we set up pulleys in different positions and create the cut with a diamond wire.</p>

						<p><a href="https://www.wemts.com/services/concrete-cutting/">Concrete cutting</a> and Wire sawing specifically, requires specialized skills for which our operators receive many hours of training to master</p>

						 <p></p>
						<h3>The Benefits of Wire Saws</h3>
					<p>There are several reasons why conventional diamond saw blades won’t work for a <a href="https://www.wemts.com/services/concrete-cutting/">Concrete Cutting</a> project: the concrete structure may be too large, the shape may be too irregular to safely work around, the location may be too inaccessible, or the structure may be too heavily reinforced for blades to cut through. Wire saws are easily able to navigate all of those problems. The benefits of using wire saws for concrete construction projects also include: </p>
						 
						<ul>
							<li>Cleaner construction areas.</li>
							<li>Deeper concrete cuts.</li>
							<li>Precision cutting.</li>
							<li>Easy access.</li>
							<li>Quiet.</li>
							<li>Quick cutting.</li>
							<li>Increased safety.</li>
						</ul>
